# Welcome to p5.js Starter Code
We're so excited that you're diving into the wonderful, creative world of p5.js! Use this program to practice writing your first program in p5.


## File Overview

### ← script.js

This is where we will add the code for our program.

### ← index.html

The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our project. We also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your project does and how you built it. 

### ← style.css

The CSS file adds styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. We will not use this file for our project and instead update the style of our game in the script.js file.
